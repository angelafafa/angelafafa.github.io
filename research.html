        <h2> Research Experience </h2>
        <p>During my undergraduate study, fascinated by the charm of survival analysis, I
          approached Professor Richard Chappell about collaborating on a related project.
          Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox model were used to assess patients’ disease risk.
          Additionally, to simplify assumptions, I switched to use the restricted mean survival time
          to estimate the treatment effect as an alternative to hazard ratio. My passion for
          applying statistical methods to solve medical issues has been cultivated by this
          hands-on experience.
